==============================================================================
 Why this repository exists
==============================================================================

This is the WsprryPi organization meta repository.

GitHub treats a repository named ".github" specially:
- Files here can apply across all repositories in the organization.
- Most of this content is consumed by GitHub itself, not end users.
- This repository is intentionally lightweight and infrastructure-focused.

The public-facing organization README lives at:
  .github/profile/README.md

If you are browsing this repository looking for code or documentation,
you are probably in the wrong place — and that is expected.

## Purpose

The `.github` repository is used by GitHub to host files that apply
across multiple repositories in the **WsprryPi** GitHub organization
such as:

- Shared GitHub Actions workflows
- Issue and pull request templates
- Repository defaults and policies
- Organization-level automation and metadata

It serves as infrastructure rather than a project or library. This
repository exists to support **organization-wide GitHub features**
for the WsprryPi project.

It does not contain application code, libraries, or end-user
documentation.

---

## Typical Contents

- Shared GitHub Actions workflows
- Issue and pull request templates
- Repository defaults and policies
- Automation and metadata used across WsprryPi projects

---

## Product Documentation

The public-facing documentation for the WsprryPi organization lives in the [Wsprry Pi Documentation](http://wsprdocs.aa0nt.net) hosted on Read the Docs.

---

## Organization README

The primary documentation for the WsprryPi organization is maintained in:

[/WsprryPi/.github/profile/README.md](./profile/README.md)

That file controls what appears on the organization’s GitHub landing page
and should be referenced for project information, goals, and links.

---

## Notes

- This repository is intentionally quiet and stable
- Changes are infrequent and administrative
- Most contributors will never need to interact with it directly
